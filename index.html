In my life, in my mind
Where I make up stories all the time
And I pretend that I am not someone
Left to face the world alone
Lately I'm not the same
I've found a stranger calling out my name
Have a feeling you would be so proud
And he's gon' need me now
But he's not you
He's not you
He will never be you
Photobook with my mistakes
Promises that we never got to make
All the things I wanna talk about
Hard to say it to myself
Wintertime, once again
In the snow I can see just where I've been
How far I've made it in the world so cold
Where I have everything
But he's not you
He's not you
He will never be you
But he's not you
He's not you
He will never be you
